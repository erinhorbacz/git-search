## Why git-search?
The search tool on GitHub currently only performs a search within the main branch of a repository. While this is helpful, is it very limited for what many developers need. **git-search** solves this problem by allowing the developer to search a key word in all branches of a git repo. Right now, the tool can only perform a search on repos that are **locally cloned** first, but I am working on expanding its capabilities!

## Get the project running on local

Navigate to the root project directory and run `npm install`, `npm run build`, and `npm start` to get the frontend running. Open another terminal window, navigate to the src folder, and run `node server.js` to get the backend running. Open http://localhost:3000/ to use the search. 

In the search bars, type in the code you want to search and the **global path** to the local git repo you want to search in. You should then see the search results pop up! You can filter by branch as well.
